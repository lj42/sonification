# Ideas

* Sentiment analysis as represented by music (sad/bad = minor; happy/good = major keys)
* Detecting outliers based on how “in tune” a data point (a person’s tweet?) is from others 
* Adding sound to streaming data (e.g. security logs)
* Sonification of images for visually-impaired people
* dissonance as point of information for the listener. work out what things would need to stand out and then assign musical behaviours
