# sonification
What happens when you mix data science and music? 

LJ: I would like to investigate how to use real-time sonification (and or real-time sound alteration) to find the most effective ways to transmit useful information to humans in the form of music.
# Not just sound but music 
While it’s possible to simply substitute midi notes for numbers, the resulting output often tends to discordant noise. I’m interested in turning complex data into musical constructs (not just linear sound analogues) while highlighting the intent behind the information.  I think this approach could leverage the information-rich quality and emotional density inside music. 



# NASA DATANAUTS: LET’S MAKE A THING! Editable project plan 

LET’S MAKE A THING! 
The Nasa Datanauts are Sonification personified!
Shall we start with something easy that will work? YES PLEASE!

# 1st PHASE SOUND COMES OUT WHEN OUR DATA SAYS SO

0.  Make a first draft of this document: DONE 9 APR 2018
1.  Make sure this document makes sense NOTFIXED
2.  brainstorm ideas on what would be fun and easy as a first sonification project DONE JUN 2018
3.  What does everyone love to do? What are people good at? Team List! ACCEPTABLE VARIANCE OF MUSIC/CODING KNOWLEDGE
4.  decide on a simple use case where we can play with some ideas DONE JUL 2018
5.  choose attributes we’d like to be notified about
6.  work out the tools required for analysing our data set IN PROGRESS
7.  decide when the attributes reach a point where notification becomes important
8.  work out how to notify the next program to start the sonification process IN PROGRESS
9.  create a trigger program that will play sounds at the appropriate times
10. work out what kind of sounds would work in what context and attach the sounds to events IN PROGRESS
11. create a plugin, website, app etc that does what we want it to do
12. It works!! Celebrate our first victory!

0.  Make a first draft of this document: DONE 9 APR 2018

1.  Make sure this document makes sense
(Please read below: is everything in the right order? Does any of this seem impossible/ not worth doing? Is there anything          worth adding? Other stuff? How do we work out that we’re all happy to proceed ? )

2. brainstorm ideas on what would be fun and easy as a first sonification project
(any and all thoughts welcome! We can put them below this heading unless we just throw them into the RocketChat)

3. What does everyone love to do? What are people good at? Team List!
(List of team capabilities and what would we like to learn more about, and where we think we can contribute, that way we know who to ask about something. Self promotion massively encouraged)

NB anyone with better MD experience, feel free to make this in to a table

4.  decide on a simple use case where we can play with some ideas
(for example: email subject keywords? RocketChat trigger words? PCAP data? twitter sentiment? )

5.  choose attributes we’d like to be notified about 
(Ideally without looking at something for maximum impact … for example: did we spend money or are we being emailed just another social media update, or someone has said something important?)

6.  work out the tools required for analysing our data set
(for example: a plugin for gmail? a JSON file querying program? could we use sentiment analysis?)

7.  decide when the attributes reach a point where notification becomes important
(for example: when an email comes in with one of our chosen keywords?)

8.  work out how to notify the next program to start the sonification process
(would we create a new database that would be called or simply send raw data somewhere?)

9.  create a trigger program that will play sounds at the appropriate times
(in the first instance we’d play back some pre-recorded sounds that I (or others) can create, eventually it would be good to get the data involved in music creation)

10.  work out what kind of sounds would work in what context and attach the sounds to events
(email example: cash register / fruit machine noise? // sentiment analysis: major key for good news / minor key for bad news? ) 

11. create a plugin, website, app etc that does what we want it to do
(may involve app development, or simply Max For Live plugin for ableton)

12. It works!! Celebrate our first victory! 
Can it work anywhere else? 

13. NEXT PROJECT IDEAS

sonification of more attributes
live sonification where the data simply comes out as raw unfiltered sound. likely not music
Live sonification where the data directly affects pitch / orchestration / timbre i.e. data becomes part of the composing process
Experiments on how many different sounds people can identify with relatively little training 
force-mapping to pitches / timbres given real time data  - what do we want to listen to and how
